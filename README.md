# spring-sandbox

##What is it?

Every now and again, I have difficulty finding an example of some spring feature on the internet.

spring-sandbox is where I create such examples for myself when I cannot find them anywhere else.

##Project structure

Currently there is 1 sub project included in this project.

* **spring-boot-properties** which demonstrates usage of Spring boot's EnableConfigurationProperties annotation. [docs](http://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/1.1.x/reference/htmlsingle/#boot-features-testing-spring-boot-applications).

##To run projects

Specific instructions to run each project can be found within each project, where documentation is available.
